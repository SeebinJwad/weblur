# weblur

online audio sharing and social media platform

TODO:

add a circle on corner of a blur's thumbnail in main page when hovered over that blur (or selected via using arrow keys)
the circle will have a character inside it determining the kind of title that the blur has, a " for quote, a T for title, a â™ª for music, a M for a mix)

how does this ui differ from spotify and soundcloud?
it has the audio player controls on the side, and much larger

august 18th 9pm-sleep time (12am-3am):
site map front end MVP complete backend started
august 19th
back end continue
august 21st 
back end complete, launch with contacts



ORDER OF PRIORITY:
*as pretty as i want the frontend to be, the big thing is backend has solid core functionality with 3 big componenets linked
	- the videos being databased and shown, from being uploaded properly to being placed on peoples screens
	- reacting to videos and interacting with them via emojis or comment reacts
	- personal profile databasing indexing and minimally viable recommendation backend for page

attach settings, about us, terms of service, and user feedback page links to site (maybe when click on profile and if no profile like with youtube have a colon you clikc on)
features that must be implemented prior to launch date august 21st:

BLUR BAR PRIORITIES:
	content in media player:
		REACTS NEEDED
			NOT NEEDED: reactions to comments
		SHARE BUTTON NEEDED (link to audio in theatre NOT NEEDED)
	
	Caption or quote media player and larger podcast channel name etc. in blur bar and views and date of vid
	media player controls for the media being played:
		NOT NEEDED: fullscreen and theatre mode (with only one column of recommended vids to right)
		NEEDED: volume control (if need be add that to settings), icon to move 5 seconds ahead and 5 seconds back
NAVBAR PRIORITIES:
	Search bar functionality NOT NEEDED,INSTEAD NEEDED IS when someone searches something, the search result page is standard weblur page but with the subnav repalaced with the text:
	'Searched for: Quotes Blurs'
	'Sorry, we do not have any results for that now'
	UPLOADING VIDEO LINK TO UPLOAD VIDEO PAGE
	
	UPLOAD VIDEO PAGE PRIORITIES:
		S TIER PRIOTIY NEEDED PRIORITY CREATE BLUR UPLOAD PAGE
	Notifications  NOT NEEDED, just like bookmark make it a dead link that when clicked maybe popup fading away text saying feature in progress
	PROFILE NEEDED S TIER, at the very least incorporate email username password creation of account (or login with google or facebook)
		needed because we need to keep track of users who use the website and send them emails or track progress of MVP etc.
BLUR CONTENT PAGE PRIORITIES:
	SUBNAV PRIORITIES: NONE, NOT NEEDED: at best each button in subnav (music, podcast, etc.) will lead to a page thats same for everyone of most popular music podcast etc.
	S TIER PRIORITY (UPLOAD AND WATCH ARE TWO THAT MAKE UP THE ABSOLUTE OBVIOUS FUNCTIONALITY) - videos databasing indexing and being shown on page with proper meta info displayed
	slight recommendatin software backend could be implmeenetd using templated machine learning or something

to have a side bar like yotubes (because weblurs sidebar is just the media player) top left of media player sider three horizontal lines that make up extend menu icon when clicked from left menu popus up same dimensions basically asblur bar and pushes blur bar more to the right and columns of blur content vids becomes 2 instead of 3


technologies that should be implemented into weblur:
progressive web app, twitter has a mobile app, but going to twitter.com on your phone is easier than downloading the app, by using html css and javascript you can make website feel like anapp, thus pwa and dramatically increase user use
AMP is an open source HTML framework developed by the AMP Open Source Project. It was originally created by Google as a competitor to Facebook Instant Articles and Apple News. AMP is optimized for mobile web browsing and intended to help webpages load faster. 
DARK MODE STANDARDIZATION
SMART SCROLL FOR BLUR BAR
PUSH NOTIFICATIONS AND EMAILS ETC
CYBERSECURITY
